# Mac-tweaks
Small tweaks, tricks etc to make working in Mac easier.
*Note: These have been tested on a Mac running macOS Mojave.*

1.  Show all files and folders(including hidden) in Finder: 
    1.  Open terminal application.
    2.  Type `defaults write com.apple.Finder AppleShowAllFiles YES` then click enter.
    3.  Click `command+shift+esc` to open *Force Quit Applications* window.
    4.  Select `Finder`(usually the last one in the list).
    5.  Click `Relaunch`  button at the bottom.
    6.  Click  `Relaunch` on the pop-up which appeared on the previous click. [Source: gotoes.org](https://gotoes.org/sales/ShowHiddenFilesMacOSX/How_To_Show_Hidden_Files.php)

2.  To save a file with your custom extension in TextEdit application,
    1.  While the TextEdit app is open click: `Format` the app's menu bar.
    2.  Click `Make Plain Text`
    3.  OR just click `shift+command+T` from your keyboard instead of the above 2 steps.

3. To adjust text size in many apps(like Terminal, TextEdit) in the Mac:
    1. Click `command+<plus>` to increase size.
    2. Click `command+<minus>` to decrease size.
    3. *Pinch-to-zoom* out or in gesture from the mouse touch pad also works in some apps like TextEdit, but not in Terminal.

4. We can change the screen resolution to adjust the size of text, icons and other things appearance; open `System Preferences` > `Displays` > in the Display tab `Resolution` option select `Scaled`, then click the one of the different options shown below.

5. Open a Terminal window directly from any location/folder in Finder, goto **System Preferences > Keyboard > Keyboard Shortcuts > Services**. Look for "New Terminal at Folder" and "New Terminal Tab at Folder" which can be found under "Files and Folders" sub-header in the list. You can also assign them shortcut keys.
